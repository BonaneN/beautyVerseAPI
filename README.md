## Project Overview
**BeautyVerse API** is a high-performance backend engine designed to bridge the gap between premium beauty products and professional artist services. It provides a unified platform where users can seamlessly transition from purchasing skincare and cosmetics to booking verified beauty professionals.


## Core Features
- **Dynamic User Evolution**: A unique "Action-based" role system. All users start as `clients`. Posting a product upgrades the account to a `seller`, while creating a professional profile upgrades it to an `artist`.
- **Enterprise Security**: Implementation of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for safe, stateless authentication and strict object-level permissions.
- **Smart Appointment Engine**: Professionals can manage their daily availability, and clients can book non-conflicting sessions in real-time.
- **Hybrid Marketplace**: Supports physical products with category management, automated discount logic, and location-based shop discovery.
- **Persistent Shopping Cart**: A modern cart implementation allowing users to aggregate professional products from various sellers.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Deep search capabilities for both the product marketplace and the artist directory based on category, price, and location.
